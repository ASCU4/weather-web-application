🌦️ Weather Web Application

This is a basic Weather Web Application built using HTML and CSS.
The web page is designed to display weather-related information in a clean and user-friendly layout.

At the moment, this project focuses on the UI and layout structure.
The JavaScript functionality and weather API integration will be added once the API key becomes active.

I built this project to strengthen my frontend development fundamentals and to improve my understanding of layout design, styling, and responsive UI creation.

For the design and overall layout, I took guidance from a YouTube tutorial.
The purpose of following the tutorial was to understand the approach and structure, so that I can independently build similar projects in the future.

📌 Note

This project is currently a basic static web page built using HTML and CSS.

The weather API is not active yet and may take up to 3 days to activate.

Once the API becomes active, JavaScript functionality will be added to fetch and display real-time weather data.

The project will be updated and completed after API integration.
